            Please review this pull request with focus on go-eth-localnet project-specific requirements.

            ## Go Best Practices & Code Quality
            - Verify code follows idiomatic Go style and conventions
            - Check that gofmt has been applied (use `go fmt`)
            - Ensure meaningful variable and function names
            - Verify functions are small and focused on single tasks
            - Check for proper error handling patterns

            ## Documentation Requirements (AGENTS.md)
            - Verify godoc comments exist for all new/modified exported functions, types, and packages
            - Check godoc comments for new tests explaining what they do and why
            - Ensure comments explain complex logic or decisions
            - Validate commit message format (imperative mood, 50 chars or less)

            ## Node Lifecycle Management Patterns (CLAUDE.md)
            - Verify context-based cancellation patterns are maintained
            - Check RPC readiness checks are preserved (5-second timeout)
            - Ensure graceful shutdown handling
            - Validate data directory management with explicit cleanup in tests

            ## Port & Resource Management
            - Verify tests use testutils.NewPort() for unique port allocation
            - Check for proper cleanup using t.Cleanup() registration
            - Ensure no port conflicts in parallel tests

            ## Testing Requirements
            - Verify all tests pass: `go test ./...`
            - Check test coverage is maintained: `go test -cover`
            - Ensure new code includes corresponding tests
            - Validate tests follow project helper function patterns (startNode, etc.)
            - Check smart contract tests validate full compilation workflow

            ## Thread-Safety & Concurrency
            - Review for race conditions in parallel tests
            - Verify proper mutex usage and synchronization
            - Check context cancellation handling

            ## LaunchOption Pattern Compliance
            - Verify new configuration follows LaunchOption pattern
            - Check option functions are properly composed
