# Ethereum Go-native Local Network
A fully Go-native tool to spin up and orchestrate a local Ethereum network composed of Geth and Prysm nodes ‚Äî either in-process or inside Docker containers ‚Äî without using Bash, Docker Compose, or non-Go tooling.

## Prerequisites

- **Go**: The project requires a minimum of **Go 1.23.10** or higher. You can download and install the required version
  from [the official Go website](https://go.dev/dl/).

Make sure you have the correct version installed by running:

```bash
go version
```

If your Go version is lower than **1.23.10**, please upgrade your Go installation.# Ethereum Go-native Localnet

## üéØ Goals

- No shell scripts, YAML, or Makefiles
- Pure Go orchestration: config, spawn, manage nodes
- Support for both modes:
  - **In-process**: embed Geth directly in Go
  - **Dockerized**: use Go SDK to control containerized nodes
- Compatible with full EL+CL setup (Geth + Prysm)

-## üöÄ Features
-
- Launch a single Geth node on localhost
- Blocks are produced using the simulated beacon
- Programmatic control over ports and datadirs
- Graceful shutdown waits for the node to close
- Pluggable support for Prysm and future CL clients
- Clean CI, linting, and testability
- Unique port allocation for reliable tests
- Explicit temp directory cleanup helpers
- Customizable genesis allocations via option functions

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-eth-localnet
cd go-eth-localnet
go run main.go
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
- [x] Single Geth node (in-process)
- [ ] Multi-node Geth network with peer connections
- [ ] Docker-mode node runner (via Go SDK)
- [ ] CL integration: Prysm processes and Engine API
- [ ] Config-driven topologies (mesh, star, etc.)

## Development
```makefile
make lint # running linter
make test # running tests
make build # running project
```
